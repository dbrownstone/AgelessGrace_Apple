            <array>
                <string>Seated in your chair, move your ankles, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, fingers and toes, neck and spine; one by one, two at a time, four at a time (i.e. both ankles and both wrists).
                    How many different ways can you move your joints? Experiment with circling them, moving them up and down, in and out, rolling, waving - PLAY with them! Explore! Finally, move them all together! How many of your joints can you use all at once? This massages the sense of humor as well as lubricates the joints!
                    Notice that the lower body &quot;mirrors&quot; the upper body: ankles are similar to wrists, knees to elbows and hips to shoulders. These parallel joints can be moved at the same time - giving you twice the benefit!</string>
                <string>There is no need to get into your swimsuit, drive to a swimming pool, wash your hair or shower afterwards!
                    Simply do all the swimming strokes you know—and as many &quot;dives&quot; as you can do in your chair! You can even paddle your feet— they will simply be in front of you instead of behind! Try the breast stroke forward, then upward; swim arm over arm; do the Australian crawl (alternate arms, turning head away from forward arm); side stroke (to left, right); back stoke (elbows bent, relaxed); tread water/dog paddle; &quot;dive&quot; down toward floor and back up; &quot;cannon ball&quot; dive—tuck head and body and roll down toward floor; swan dive — with arms back like wings as you &quot;dive&quot;; and jackknife dive, arms extended down toward feet and toes. Shake all the water off like a puppy would!</string>
                <string>&quot;Spell&quot; with various body parts for six minutes, e.g., &quot;spell&quot; or &quot;write&quot; in the air the word S-I-X, from largest size block letters to small ones.
                    &quot;Draw&quot; in the air a large S with both your arms and hands a few feet high. Draw an S with your elbows (one at a time or together), draw an S with right foot, left foot, with your nose, your pinkie fingers, your knees (one at a time);
                    &quot;spell&quot; with your belly button or tail bone. This is great for a laugh and great for the core muscles! Trace the letter on the floor with your toes. Then do the same spelling movements with I and X...or how about the word S-E-X? That works, too! You can spell any word in block letters, or in cursive or script — even in a foreign language.
                    This is a great way to learn French, for example! Spell a new French word every day with your body parts. This workout is great for kinesthetic learning (remembering and being taught through the body). Spell your name, your city or state, your grandkids&apos; names—whatever words come to mind!</string>
                <string>Pretend to vigorously play various musical instruments as you tap both feet or heels with fun, upbeat music playing in the background for inspiration! Practice as if you are ambidextrous, playing on both right and left sides.
                    Play piano back and forth with your fingers moving in full and broken chords; play trumpet up and down, and side to side like a jazz musician; play flute to both sides of your body; play guitar—strumming first with your right hand, then with your left; play drums (taller congas, a drum set, lower bongos, etc.); play cowbells with a drumstick, to each side of your body; play slide trombone, right then left; play accordion; shake maracas; play standup bass on left and right; play xylophone up and down; play saxophone, jazz-style, to left and right sides, up and down in front. Play the organ and be sure to use your feet up and down the pedals. Become the conductor of the orchestra. Just PLAY!</string>
                <string>Move like various wild animals would, making appropriate sounds. (Sounding helps with core muscles, abdominal support for spine and lower back, lung capacity and breathing).
                    Crawl like any fourlegged creature — in the air if seated or standing, or actually on the floor; soar like an eagle, fly like a sparrow, swoop like a seagull; dive like a dolphin; swim like a fish; growl and claw your hands like a lion; stalk or prowl like a tiger; stretch your neck up and around like a giraffe; mimic a monkey; use one arm at a time and swing it like the trunk of an elephant; laugh like a hyena; slither like a boa constrictor or caterpillar. Feel more domestic? Whinny and shake your head like a horse; wag your tail like a dog, bark, scratch fleas, pant or howl; meow and stretch or claw like a cat; use your elbows to flap chicken wings and cluck, or crow like a rooster; wiggle your nose and hold your &quot;paws&quot; up like a bunny. How many more animals can you think of? How do they move? What sounds or motions do they make?</string>
                <string>Breathe smoothly and steadily as you play with the concept of slow, deliberate, elegant movements. Pay close attention as you watch your moving body parts, similar to Tai Chi.
                    Push with your hands as if you are moving space or moving energy side-to-side; watch your hands with your eyes; shift your weight from side-to-side, rock back-to-front from your hip joints (can still be done seated). Control each movement, making circles and spirals, waves and figure eights, while decelerating all your movements to &quot;slow motion.&quot; Play with the space and energy as if it is tangible, like a ball of taffy, sticking from one hand to the other, squishing it palm-to-palm. Hold an imaginary ball in your hands and move it across the sky; swirl the ocean currents with your palms; raise your hands and eyes like the sunrise and lower them to the ground like the sunset. Remember to rotate around the axis of your spine, looking back behind you to left and then right, all the while moving very slowly. Imagine executing any normal activity of daily living in slow motion (i.e., brushing your hair, taking a walk, washing dishes, mowing the lawn).</string>
                <string>Breathe slowly and use yoga-style movements to align the bones and joints; form V-shapes with the arms; bend over toward the floor; twist your spine gently and look back over each shoulder; balance on one foot (seated, standing behind the chair, down on the floor); do traditional yoga postures if you know them; modify them to accommodate sitting (or standing or holding onto a chair).
                    Use the arms and legs to create angles or triangles; bend over the back of a chair and do a &quot;headstand&quot;, your head resting on the seat. Stand in front of a chair doing a &quot;headstand&quot;; come up very slowly, one vertebra at a time, eyes looking down to allow the fluid to settle back down onto the floor of the ear canals to eliminate dizziness. Take time and look at the floor as you slowly arise, then look out a little in front of you, before raising your eyes to look straight ahead. Lift and lower your heels to &quot;tap down&quot; on the floor to settle fluid in the ear canals. Pat the tummy at the hara or tan tree — the balance point or center of gravity about two inches below the navel, located inside the center of the body, not on the front or back. Sit and arch your back against the chair; look up at the ceiling, stretch to one side, opposite arm over the head, and then stretch to the other side. Hold the side of the seat or arm of the chair, cross your legs and look back over the right shoulder as you hold the stretch; repeat on the left.</string>
                <string>Count Your Blessings! Energetically and quickly play with numbers and sequences in a variety of movements. Tap your right hand and right foot 8 times; alternate with the left; then tap 4, then 2; clap without allowing the hands to touch together, stopping a few inches apart, 8 times, 4 times, 2 times; play with odd numbers as well; tap the hand and foot 5 times, clap 3 times—repeat on both sides; tap 3 times, clap 1.
                    Criss-cross or &quot;scissor&quot; your arms and hands in single counts. Lift your legs off the floor, alternating right and left as you count. Imagine playing &quot;patty cake&quot; - both hands straight ahead, then crisscross hands or pat the thighs, repeating several times. Say the numbers you are clapping, patting or lifting aloud as you execute them. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Then 1,2,3,4. Then 1,2,1,2. Count backwards! 4,3,2,1. As quickly as you can, pat right shoulder with left hand, then left shoulder with right hand; then tap right hip with left hand and left hip with right hand. Move your brain and body at the same time! The more you &quot;mess up&quot;, the more you challenge the brain!</string>
                <string>Draw vertical or horizontal lines, circles and triangles in the air with your arms, hands, elbows, nose, each knee, your ring finger, thumbs, toes, or bellybutton. Relax your elbows and knees as you draw. Smile as you do this! Lift one leg at a time and play with linear movements, circular movements, then triangular movements.
                    Combine lines and circles to create spirals or waves. Draw a circle with one hand, a line with your foot and a triangle with the other hand (activate your sense of humor!); attempt to draw one of each shape simultaneously with different body parts; do your best to coordinate mind and body! Watch your hands and feet, your legs and arms, as you draw the lines, circles and triangles in order to engage your head and neck. Lift your legs off the floor as you draw the geometric shapes with them, alternating between left and right, to engage the hip joints.</string>
                <string>Seated, lift your feet off the floor; point and flex each foot out in front of you, pumping the ankles to pump blood to the main arteries, heart and brain. Practice kicks of all kinds—singles; doubles; fans (sweep up, over and to the right or up, over and to the left); the &quot;rockette&quot; kick (lift knee up, tap toes down; kick foot out and tap toes down); make sounds like &quot;Whee!&quot; as you kick.
                    Alternate kicks toward the corners of the room. Pretend you are tap dancing. Wiggle the toes as if they are fingers. Use your fingers at the same time to &quot;inspire&quot; your toes to move! Attempt to lift one toe at a time, in sequence; press down onto the floor with the toes; tap toe-heel several times with each foot. Reverse and try heel-toe. Manually move the toes with your hands, one at a time, back, forth, around. Walk barefoot at home as much as possible to stimulate the 7000 nerve endings in each foot. Drop a tissue on the floor, pick it up with your toes and give it to your opposite hand. Repeat several times with each foot. Then use a cloth napkin or hand towel. &quot;Pleat&quot; the tissue, napkin or towel with your toes. Rub the bottom of each foot back and forth with pressure on a tennis ball or &quot;super ball&quot; for a couple minutes. Practice while watching TV!</string>
                <string>Shape your spine like a piece of al dente spaghetti or a pipe cleaner, bending front, back, side-to-side, rotating, swaying, waving, folding over. (Note: The lower back moves and is moved by the pelvis and tailbone; mid-back and shoulder blades move and are moved by the ribcage and elbows; neck moves and is moved by the head and eyes.)
                    Lift up and down with the shoulders and rib cage as if you are opening the &quot;venetian blinds&quot; of your ribcage. Move elbows forward, up and down in front of your body; &quot;nudge&quot; to the right and left or behind you to cause the ribcage to move and shift—even a little feels like a lot of motion. Hold your arms out to your sides and pretend that you are &quot;bouncing off the walls&quot; to your right and left. Move your neck by looking from right to left, and back again, from ceiling to floor and back again. Wiggle your tailbone as you sit in the chair (or on the floor or standing). Shake it as if you are wagging your tail, swish it as if you are a lion, tiger or cat; balance on it as if you are a kangaroo! Bump your hips from side to side and front to back.</string>
                <string>Use your fingers, arms and hands to &quot;speak.&quot; Knead with the fingers as if you are making biscuit dough; turn palms up and palms down as you knead; wiggle fingers like &quot;gummy worms;&quot; shake water drops off of your fingers; shoot sparks out your finger tips; face palms and push fingers against each other with gentle pressure; press, release and repeat. Use the fingers of one hand to massage the opposite shoulder for a minute; then change hand and shoulder.
                    Punch holes in the air. Snap your fingers. Cross/uncross your fingers and make a wish. Do &quot;finger pushups&quot; on the floor, seat or arm of your chair. &quot;Play&quot; up and down a piano keyboard. Wave your arms like a sparrow, a sea gull, or an eagle. Circle your shoulders forward, then back. Point in different directions with your elbows. Shrug your shoulders like a teenager and say &quot;I don&apos;t know!&quot; &quot;Wasn&apos;t me!&quot; Shrug slowly, then quickly. Clap your hands behind your back. Make dramatic gestures with your hands and arms like a &quot;drama queen.&quot; Wave as if riding in a parade, alternating hands. Wave your arms to get someone&apos;s attention. Pretend you are a traffic cop, wave forward, stop, start, etc. Relax your jaw, open your palms, and shake your hands, arms, then shoulders.</string>
                <string>Especially for the handyman and gardener in all of us...ambidextrously (using both left and right sides of the body), act as if you are using tools for carpentry, plumbing, gardening and yard work; use your hands and arms, back and chest as if hammering nails into the wall; then lean down and hammer into the floor; pretend you are operating a jack hammer and vibrate and bounce (engage the legs and feet); turn a screwdriver with your forearms and hands (rotating the spiraling bones of the lower arms); use a hand saw, back and forth on each side of the body; operate a weed-whacker or hedge trimmer; use your hands to prune. Dig with a shovel or spade, using your foot and leg to push down on the spade; alternate sides.
                    Turn wrenches with both hands; inward, then outward. Chop wood with an axe. Operate a rotor-tiller (engaging core and legs). Swing a sledge hammer or crowbar. Use a sander in circular motions. Push a lawn mower. Use your imagination!</string>
                <string>The muscles in the cheeks, neck and forehead are basically the same as the muscles in the upper arm, thighs, abdominals or calves. You can contract and relax them, pump them, strengthen them—and tighten and tone them.
                    Stick out your lower lip and attempt to curl it up and touch your nose with it—&quot;try&quot; this over and over! Scrunch up your cheeks like little apples and then relax, repeating this many times until your face tires. Raise and lower your eyebrows as if you are attempting to touch your hairline. Do it slowly, do it quickly, until your facial muscles fatigue. Smile so widely that it goes into your ears; relax and repeat again and again. Wiggle your nose like a bunny. Attempt to wiggle your ears. Stick out your tongue and retract it quickly. It doesn&apos;t matter if you can do all these moves. It matters that your mind is sending the message to your body to attempt to do it. Make silly and distorted faces as quickly as you can. Laugh out loud using your face, eyes, lips and cheeks as much as possible—fake it until you make it true laughter! If all else fails—look at yourself in the mirror as you practice these movements—that will do it! Laugh heartily, hysterically, enthusiastically throwing back the head.</string>
                <string>Pay attention to moving the toes and feet; to the center of gravity or balance point of the body (two inches below the navel in the center of the body); and to the fluid in the three ear canals.
                    Seated, move your head right to left as quickly as is comfortable; wag the head; circle the head; watch rapid, random moves of your hands. While sitting or holding onto the back of a chair, practice &quot;turning&quot; as quickly as possible to each side. Hold onto the back of a chair and lift one leg like a flamingo, alternate and hold each side for 30 seconds. Stand on one leg and soften the knee, like a cat about to pounce. Shift your weight from one foot to the other, moving more and more slowly, staying longer and longer on each side. Point and look where you are pointing, moving the head as if seeing lots of new and exciting sights! Like a small child, say no and shake your head emphatically. Enthusiastically nod yes to ice cream! Float in space, as if you are filled with helium. Play with being on and off balance, as you sit or stand and hold onto the back of the chair. Sit and wiggle your toes and flex your feet. Push down into the floor with the balls of your feet and your toes. Find the balance point of each foot (at the base of the second toe, between the second and third toe); press down into the point, lifting up with the head at the same time.</string>
                <string>Breathe normally and naturally, rather than so deeply that you feel lightheaded. Put one hand on your belly and one on your chest or solar plexus; breathe in slowly and sense the belly and lungs filling up with air like a balloon being blown up.
                    Breathe out slowly, deeply, and sense the body &quot;deflating&quot; like a balloon losing air. Breathe in through the nose and out through the nose; breathe in through the nose and out through the lips; breathe in through the lips and out through the lips; breathe in through the lips and out through the nose. Repeat the sequence two more times for a full exchange of oxygen to the lungs, bloodstream and brain—an &quot;oxygen cocktail&quot; that might make you a bit giddy! This is a good energy lift in the afternoon — or good to help you relax and sleep at night. Focus on the exhale to regain breath if you feel winded or &quot;out of breath.&quot; Imagine blowing into a paper bag. Pant like a puppy. Sing out loud: &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat,&quot; &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb,&quot; &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; Sounding and use of the breath are excellent for lung capacity and the vascular system. Make sounds — wow, man, pow, pop, ooh, ahhh, yes, no, phooey, hiss, pshaw, any sound you think of; expel your breath so that the body automatically inhales afterwards.</string>
                <string>Sit in your chair and grab the air with your hands as if you are &quot;snatching&quot; things—apples, stardust, ladybugs, fireflies, pennies from heaven—quickly and with as much agility as you can.
                    Remember flying or falling objects could be high in the air, to your right or left, behind your head or neck, under your knees, down close to the floor, all around you in every direction—here, there and everywhere. Grab, grab, grab - and yet hold the inside of the palm relaxed while the fingers close and open with strength, so the &quot;firefly&quot; or &quot;ladybug&quot; can still breathe inside your closed hand! Say &quot;grab&quot; or &quot;gotcha&quot; each time you do the movement!</string>
                <string>Begin shaking, vibrating, tremoring, shimmying, jack-hammering — slowly, then at a medium speed, then fast.
                    Shake and vibrate one at a time with your shoulders, hips, head, tail bone; then with your whole body. Shake your arms, one at a time, both at once. Shake your legs, one at time, both at once. Shake or shimmy by playing &quot;ping pong&quot; from shoulder-to-shoulder, varying the speeds, the way a ping pong game starts out slowly, warms up, and then gets going rapidly back and forth. Shake and vibrate other parts of the body in shimmy style. Shake your entire body as if you are a puppy coming in out of the rain. Can you do this for a full minute? Two minutes? Wow!</string>
                <string>While seated, pretend to play various sports (alternating both left and right sides of the body). Try bicycling; tennis (forehand, backhand; lob and serve on each side); baseball (pitching, then batting with both hands and arms); throwing a Frisbee; bowling; archery; swinging a golf club; mountain climbing; rock climbing; tug of war; passing a football or kicking a field goal; basketball (shooting hoops with both hands or dribbling,
                    Globetrotter style, under the legs, around the back); riflery; weight lifting; kicking a soccer ball (with your foot, knee, head, shoulder, etc.); swimming (practicing all the strokes, breast, dog paddle, Australian crawl, back stroke, side strokes, and various dives); boxing or sparring; horseback riding (posting, legs wide). Go for the gold!</string>
                <string>While sitting, bend down and try to touch the floor, and come back to a seated position. Then, using the arms of the chair, push up to standing or halfway up. Return to seated position. Repeat this sequence as rapidly as you can.
                    Sit, reach down to floor, sit, stand or push up, sit, reach down to floor, sit, stand or push up, etc. Another option is to get all the way down onto the floor and get back up, using the chair for support. If you haven&apos;t done this in many years (or perhaps since you were a child!), this is one of the best possible exercises you can do to condition all your joints, major and minor muscles, tendons and connective tissue. Practice this near the chair (or a sofa or bed), so you have the reassurance and comfort of knowing you have something to hold onto if you need support. You can put pillows on the floor for comfort and safety. See how many times you can get down and back up in one to two minutes. Lower yourself differently each time, to your right, to your left, facing backward, front, etc.</string>
                <string>Yes, vigorously dance in your chair, so it works your core muscles! Play music from your youth or childhood.
                    Put on music that you like, new music that you&apos;ve never heard, music you don&apos;t like (to inspire you to move differently than you typically move!). Play &quot;music roulette&quot; and just put your MP3 player, CD changer or stereo on &quot;random&quot; and dance and move to whatever comes up! Move from top to bottom, from side-to-side. Dance your back as well as your front. Reach up high, reach down low, move all around. Dance flowing, dance linear, dance twisting and spiraling. Feel free to make sounds as you dance in your chair! Wheee! Whoopee! Rock out! Jam! Dance as if no one is watching you and you are alone in your living room!</string>
